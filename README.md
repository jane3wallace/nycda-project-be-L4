# NYCDA BE Lesson 4: <i>Sinatra App</i>
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Back End 101 class in New York after Week 2 Lecture 2. This project was a Ruby web application using Sinatra.

### Assignment:
Take a personal website project and convert it to a Ruby / Sinatra site. The site should have at least 3 sections and one of the pages should have a "Contact Me" form that allows users to submit a post request to your app.
